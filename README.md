We have chosen to work on the country risk about the natural disasters. It's linked to finance because this programm could help to determine whether or not it is risky to invest into a certain country. Indeed a natural disaster which hit a country could put this country into recession.
The database is composed of disaster type (drought, volcanic activity, flood, storm, earthquake, epidemic, wildfire, landslide...), the country, the start and end date, the total deaths and the total damages among others, between 1900 and 2021.
The programm will be able to display a world map showing countries colored more or less brightly depending on the risk of the disaster type chosen.
To be able to work with map and countries on Python, we need a package that needs to be imported: folium. And we also need the pandas package that we already know which allows to read database.
In the code, we have tested with the drought disaster, but we can easily change the disater type at the beginning of the code if we change the varaible "study".
In the github commubity, we have also put some maps that display country risks about some disater types: drought, storm, epidemic and wildfire.

We hope you will enjoy the programm.
